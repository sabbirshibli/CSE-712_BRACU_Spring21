# Courses done for gaining some extra-credits/bonus marks
Hello there,  
This is Sabbir Ahmed Sibli, currently studying MSc. in Computer Science, BRAC University.  
This topic has been submitted as a partial fulfillment for CSE 712 - Symbolic Machine Learning II under MSc. in CSE Program, BRAC University.  
During last couple of weeks, I've done some courses from **YouTube** platform on based on Natural Language Processing. Here are the brief of the courses, practical works and some links of online resources. I found these courses are very helpful to me. As I have no paid membership on several course sites like Coursera etc. I haven't able to done certified courses. I ask for consideration form the course Instructor on this matter.  
  
***Courses***  
**Course 01: Natural Language Processing - Stanford University by Dan Jurafsky**  
From this course, Majorly I've learnt-  
1. Basics of Regular Expressions.  
2. Word Processing using Unix Tools.  
3. Basics on Noisy Channel and Correction.  
4. Text Classification algorithms (i.e. Naive Bayes, Linear Classifiers).  
5. Basics of Sentiment Analysis.  
6. Feature Extraction Procedures.

**Course 02: Natural Language Processing - University of Michigan by Dragomir Radev, Ph.D**  
From this course, Majorly I've learnt-  
1. Basics of Linguistic Intuitions for Natural Language Processing (Text processing, human to human interaction, grammer, Morphology & Lexicons etc.).  
2. About NACLO (A Competition in Linguistics).  
3. Language Pre Processing (Tokenization, Normalization, Stemming, Morphological Analysis, Capitalization, Word Extraction etc.).  
4. Feature Extraction (Thesaurus-based word similarity methods, The Vector Space Model, Dimensionality Reduction etc.).
5. Parsing, Prepositional Phrase processing.  
6. Classification Algorithms (Basic Probabilities, Bayes Theorem etc.).  
7. Language Modeling.

**Course 03: Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces by DeepLearning.AI & Coursera (Ongoing)**  
It's a large course and I am still in progress of it. But Already I've learnt topics from this course such as-  
1. Supervised Machine Learning.  
2. Sentiment Analysis.  
3. Vocabulary & Feature Extraction.  
4. Feature Vectors.  
5. Logistic Regression for NLP.

***Tutorials & Hands on Experiments***  
**Practical 01: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tutorial with Python & NLTK) by freeCodeCamp sponsored by Edureka**  
Outcome: From this video tutorial, I've learnt using Python NLTK library tool for Text Tokenizing (Bigrams, Trigrams, Ngrams), Normalizing (Stemming), Lemmatization, StopWords, Parts of Speech Processing, Named Entity Recognition, Chunking etc. (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2vAabgKiuM)  

**Practical 02: Naive Bayes Classifier in Python by Edureka**  
Outcome: Basic overview of Naive Bayes Classifier (Gaussian, Multinomial & Bernoulli) & A Project named "PIMA Diabetics Test Prediction" (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz_xuxYS2PM&t=1486s)  

**Practical 03: Naive Bayes Classifier With Example by Simplilearn**
Outcome: Basics of Naive Bayes Classifier & A Project named "Use Case - Text Classification for News Websites" (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3dZ6ZNFjo0)    

**Some Articles that helped me throughout the NLP Journey (Still going)**
