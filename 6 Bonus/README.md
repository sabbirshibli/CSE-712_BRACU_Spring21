# Courses done for gaining some extra-credits/bonus marks
Hello there,  
This is Sabbir Ahmed Sibli, currently studying MSc. in Computer Science, BRAC University.  
This topic has been submitted as a partial fulfillment for CSE 707 - Disributed Computing System under MSc. in CSE Program, BRAC University.  
During last couple of weeks, I've done two courses from **LinkedIn Learning** platform on Cloud Computing and DevOPs. Here are the brief and certificates as the evidences.  
  
**Course 01: Learning Cloud Computing: Core Concepts**  
From this course, I've learnt-  
1. What Cloud Computing is.  
2. Types of Cloud Deployments - Private, Public & Hybrid.  
3. Major Cloud Types - Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrustructure as a Service (IaaS) & Platform as a Service (PaaS).  
4. Basics of Migrating Local files to Clouds.  
5. Parameters of choosing a Cloud Provider.  
6. Cloud Security Basics.  
This is to mention that, I've also passed the quizing during this course. Here is the certificate I've achieved from this course,

**Course 02: Learning Docker**  
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. From this course, I've learnt-  
1. What Docker is.  
2. Setting up Docker (I used Docker desktop for windows and use that from CMD).  
3. Creating multiple containers, exporting containers as an individual Image.  
4. About Docker Registers, Image & Container Process IDs.
5. Networking with Docker (Container to Container connection one as host and another as client.)  
6. Processes and CGroup maintanance using Docker Images.  
This is to mention that, I've also passed the quizing during this course. Here is the certificate I've achieved from this course,
